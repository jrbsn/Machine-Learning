# Machine-Learning
                              

Capabilities:
  - Flight Simulations:
    - Basic inputs: avg. thrust, static drag coefficient. But, has variable mass with thrust and variable air density
    - Outputs: Apogee3
  - Inflation Simulations:
    - Uses inflation curve method to predict maximum drag force during parachute inflation
  
  - TensorFlow Deep Learning Networks:
    - Apogee Predictor: predicts apogee using dataset of thousands of simulations with randomized inputs
